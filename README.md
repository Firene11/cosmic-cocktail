GIVEN a cocktail app
WHEN I pick my zodiac sign from a list of all zodiac signs
THEN I am presented with a randomly generated space themed image and a cocktail which features an image and it's ingredients to make that said cocktail. 
THEN if I want to generate a new cocktail, I am presented with a button to try again. 
WHEN I click on the button to try again
THEN I am presented with a new randomly generated space image and cocktail.
WHEN I am done generating cocktails and images 
THEN my choices are added to local storage.
