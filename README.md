## Usage
---
When you load the application, you are presented with an interactive page where you can click on links to view stored cocktails (The Galactic Shelf) and the top five cocktails (Big Bangers). 

You are also presented with a choice of zodiac signs. When you choose a zodiac sign, you are presented with a user creation page which displays a randomly generated space themed background image along with the generated cocktail and it's ingredients and instructions.

 If you want to generate a new cocktail, you may press the button to try again. When you are finished generating cocktails, your choice(s) is added to local storage (The Galactic Shelf).

## User Story
GIVEN a cocktail app WHEN I pick my zodiac sign from a list of all zodiac signs 

THEN I am presented with a randomly generated space themed image and a cocktail which features an image and it's ingredients to make that said cocktail. 

THEN if I want to generate a new cocktail, I am presented with a button to try again. 

WHEN I click on the button to try again THEN I am presented with a new randomly generated space image and cocktail.

WHEN I am done generating cocktails and images THEN my choices are added to local storage.
